# <u>Built-in Python Key Concepts</u>
### Function:
- A Function is A process for executing a task that can accept input and return an output
### Classes:
- A way of grouping functions (as methods) and data (as properties) into a logical.
### Scope:
- Where our variables can be accessed
### Dictionaries 
- Are essentially key-value pairs, very similar to JSON format
### List Methods
- Append = Add to the end of a list
- Insert =  Insert an item at a given position
- Extend = Add to the end of a list all values passed to extend
### Tuple
- Same concept as a list, but the data cannot be changed. (They are faster than lists)
# <br></br> <u>Error Types</u> 
### SyntaxError
- Occurs when Python encounters an incorrect syntax
### NameError
- Occurs when a variable is not defined
### TypeError
- Occurs when: 
    - An operation or function is applied to the wrong type.
    - Python cannot interpret an operation on two objects
### IndexError
- Occurs when you try to access an element in a list using an invalid index
### ValueError
- Occurs when a built-in operation or function receives an arg that has the right type but an inappropriate value
### KeyError
- Dictionary does not have a specific key
### AttributeError
- Variable does not have an attribute
# <br></br><u>API Concepts</u>
### GET:
- Retrieve data

### PUT: 
- Replace data

### POST 
- Create data

### DELETE
- Delete data

### SOAP APIs 
- Rigid and only allow XML messaging between applications. The application server also has to maintain the state of each client. This means it has to remember all previous requests when processing a new request.

### REST
-  Flexible and allows applications to transfer data as plain text, HTML, XML, and JSON. REST is also stateless, so the REST API treats every new request independently of previous requests.
