# **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**
Structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software
## Stage-1: Planning and Requirement Analysis
    - The information from the analysis forms the building blocks of a basic project. 
    - requirement analysis is also performed by the developers of the organization. This is attained from customer inputs, and sales department/market surveys. 
    - The quality of the project is a result of planning.
## Stage-2: Defining Requirements
    - In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. 
    - These requirements get approval from customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. 
## Stage-3: Designing Architecture
    - SRS (Software Requirement Specification) is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software.
## Stage-4: Developing Product
    - At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the Design Document Specification (DDS). 
## Stage-5: Product Testing and Integration
    - After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution.
    - Therefore, at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested
## Stage-6: Deployment and Maintenance of Products
    - Product is released in phases as per the organizationâ€™s strategy. Then it is tested in a real industrial environment. It is important to ensure its smooth performance.



# **Software Development Lifecycle Models**
There are a total of six development lifecycle models. They are like the spell checkers of software development.
## Waterfall Development:
    - In the waterfall model, once a phase seems to be completed, it cannot be changed.
    - Due to this less flexible nature, the waterfall model is not in practice anymore.
## Agile Model:
    - The main goal of the Agile model is to facilitate quick project completion. 
    - The agile model refers to a group of development processes. 
## Iterative Model:
    - Each cycle results in a semi-developed but deployable version; with each cycle, some requirements are added to the software, and the final cycle results in the software with the complete requirement specification.
## Spiral Model:
    - Models that provides support for risk handling. It has various spirals in its diagrammatic representation.
## V-Shaped Model:
    - Each stage or phase of this model is integrated with a testing phase.
    - It is also known as the verification or validation model.
## DevOps
    - Where developers and Operational teams work together to accelerate innovation and deployment quality.
