# <u>***Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**</u>*
<b>SDLC</b> is a structured process that is used to design, develop, and test good-quality software.
### <u>Stage-1: Planning and Requirement Analysis</u>

- The information from the analysis forms the building blocks of a basic project. 
- Requirement analysis is also performed by the developers of the organization. This is attained from customer inputs, and sales department/market surveys. 
- The quality of the project is a result of planning.

### <u>Stage-2: Defining Requirements</u>
- In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. 
- These requirements get approval from customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. 

### <u>Stage-3: Designing Architecture</u>
- SRS (Software Requirement Specification) is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software.

### <u>Stage-4: Developing Product</u>
- At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the Design Document Specification (DDS). 

### <u>Stage-5: Product Testing and Integration</u>
- After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution.
- Therefore, at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested.

### <u>Stage-6: Deployment and Maintenance of Products</u>
- Product is released in phases as per the organization’s strategy. Then it is tested in a real industrial environment. It is important to ensure its smooth performance.



# <br><u>**Software Development Lifecycle Models**</u></br>
There are a total of <b>six development lifecycle models</b>. They are like the spell checkers of software development.

### <u>Waterfall Development:</u>
- In the waterfall model, once a phase seems to be completed, it cannot be changed.
- Due to this less flexible nature, the waterfall model is not in practice anymore.

### <u>Agile Model:</u>
- The main goal of the Agile model is to facilitate quick project completion. 
- The agile model refers to a group of development processes. 

### <u>Iterative Model:</u>
- Each cycle results in a semi-developed but deployable version; with each cycle, some requirements are added to the software, and the final cycle results in the software with the complete requirement specification.

### <u>Spiral Model:</u>
- Models that provides support for risk handling. It has various spirals in its diagrammatic representation.

### <u>V-Shaped Model:</u>
- Each stage or phase of this model is integrated with a testing phase.
- It is also known as the verification or validation model.

### <u>DevOps</u>
- Where developers and Operational teams work together to accelerate innovation and deployment quality.


# <br><u>Test Driven Development (TDD)</u></br>
Software Development practice that focuses on creating unit test acases before developing the actual code.

### <u>Code Coverage:</u>
 - Metric to show how much of your source code is tested.
    
### <u>Function coverage:</u>
- How many of the functions defined have been called.

### <u>Statement coverage:</u>
- How many of the statements in the program have been executed.

### <u>Branches coverage:</u>
- How many of the branches of the control structures (if statements, for instance) have been executed.

### <u>Condition coverage:</u>
- How many of the boolean sub-expressions have been tested for a true and a false value.

### <u>Line coverage:</u>
- How many lines of source code have been tested.
 
### <u>Unit Test: </u>
- The smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system
- In most languages, that is the "function," "subroutine," "method," or "property."

### <u>TTD (Test Driven Development):</u>
- Writes your test before writing production code.
 
### <u>Integration Testing:</u>
- This type of software testing is where components are gradually integrated and then tested as a group.
- Modules may work individually, but when they are brought together, they can fail.
 
### <u>Test Management:</u>
- Process where testing activities are managed.
- Modules may work individually, but when they are brought together, they can fail.

# <br><u>Testing Types</u></br>
### <u>Functional testing</u>
- Testing functionalities for proper behavior
### <u>Usability testing</u>
- Evaluating product’s ease of use and intuitiveness
### <u>Security testing</u>
- Checking the security of the application through the network, data, APIs and other components
Includes testing for issues like unauthorized access, data breaches, and injection attacks
### <u>Exploratory testing</u>	
- This form of testing is unscripted and focuses on finding issues in the system
Relies heavily of the tester’s understanding of the product
### <u>Smoke testing</u>
- A preliminary round of testing to quickly assess if the software is stable enough for further testing
### <u>Regression testing</u>
- Form of testing done to ensure that existing functionalities do not get impacted after introduction of new features or fixes
### <u>Alpha testing</u>
- This kind of acceptance testing is conducted by the internal QA team to identify defects before release
### <u>Beta testing</u>
- Beta testing involves real users testing the software in a controlled environment before it’s widely released
### <u>Sanity testing</u>
- Validates at a high level if the functionalities are working as expected
Further testing is done based on these results
### <u>Performance testing</u>	
- Checks the performance of the application under different conditions like the product’s responsiveness, scalability, and stability under varying load conditions
Includes targeted testing types like load testing and stress testing
### <u>Load testing</u>
- Evaluates the product under peak load to identify bottlenecks and scalability issues
### <u>Stress testing</u>
- Tests the product’s stability and performance under extreme conditions
